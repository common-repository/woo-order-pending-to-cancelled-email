Brings back the email notification when an order status changes from pending to cancelled.

== Description ==
In previous versions of WooCommerce, when an order status changed from pending to cancelled, an email notification was sent automatically.
In WooCommerce 3.0.8, however, they've removed this (see <a href="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt">changelog</a>).

This (very) simple plugin brings back this email.
